Streaming & Visualization Server
---

I am working on putting together a casual streaming data agregation service (by casual I mean fewer than 10 updates per second).  It uses an irc as the messaging platform -- visit it at irc.robscanlon.com (join #github or #wikipedia to view the streams).  This is a complete work in progress!

To start, I put together a stream of live github updates, and a visualization in the style of the 80's movie WarGames. Check it out at [the running server](http://streams.robscanlon.com/github).
I plan on adding more data feeds and visualizations as I have time, so check back soon.
